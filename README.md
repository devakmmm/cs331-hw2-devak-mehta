# HW2 – Devak Mehta

This repository contains my submission for **CSCI 331 – Homework 2** using the `WideWorldImporters` database.  
The assignment required us to write **20 propositions** and corresponding SQL queries, formatted as both a `.sql` script and a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with outputs.

## 📂 Contents
- **HW2_DevakMehta.sql** → All propositions (commented) + SQL queries.  
- **HW2_DevakMehta.ipynb** → Notebook with propositions, queries, and saved outputs.  
- **Video Walkthrough** → [link here once uploaded]

## 📝 Notes
- Although the requirement was 20 queries, I included **21 total**.  
  - **Proposition 11 (Unit Price with 8% tax)** was a real-world style question I was recently asked in an interview.  
  - I chose to keep it here so you can see how I approached a practical SQL calculation problem.
